## CS455..*Distributed Systems: Using Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Paths to Route Packets in a Network Overlay
### Author: Evan Steiner
### Purpose: Building network overlay with multi..*node communication using dijkstra's shortest path to route packets

#### Instructions, Compilation/Running:
  *Compile on command line: "gradle build"
  *Startup registry:
    *navigate to "cs455.overlay/build/classes/java/main"
    *from that directory: "java cs455.overlay.node.Registry {portnum}"
  *Startup however many messaging nodes you would like, more than 1.
	*navigate to "cs455.overlay/build/classes/java/main" on any machine
	*from that directory: "java cs455.overlay.node.MessagingNode {registryName/IP} {registryPortNum}"
	*node will automatically register with registry if found on that name/ip and port
  *Start running registry and/or messaging node commands.
	*Presumably you should first setup overlay on registry

#### Commands:
	..* Registry Commands:
		* list..*messaging..*nodes: lists all registered messaging nodes.
		* setup..*overlay {numLinks}: setup overlay of nodes with {numLinks} connections each
			where {numLinks} %2 == 0 AND 1 < {numLinks} < # of registered nodes
		* send..*overlay..*link..*weights: send randomly generated link weights to overlay nodes for use in shortest path.
		* start {numRounds}: starts {numRounds} rounds where each messaging node sends 5 messages per round to random other messaging
			node using shortest path calculations.
		* quit: stops execution of messaging node program.
	..* Messaging Node Commands:
		* exit..*overlay: de..*registers node with registry.
		* print..*shortest..*path: prints shortest path to each other node.
		* quit: stops execution of messaging node program.

#### Notes:
	..* Registry will wait 15 seconds after receiving last task complete message before requesting statistics.
	..* Should run fairly fast at around 15,000 rounds or less, more rounds will take increasingly longer in time.

#### Classes/Project Structure:
	..* dijkstra
		..* RoutingCache.java: Storing shortest path to each other node in overlay, also can print them.
		..* ShortestPath.java: Calculating shortest path to each other node in overlay.
	..* node
		..* Node.java: Abstract class inherited by Registry and MessagingNode holds general node information.
		..* Registry.java: Class responsible for overseeing node overlay communications, creation of overlay, statistics etc.
		..* MessagingNode.java: Class responsible for handling bulk of messages within overlay creating connections between nodes etc.
	..* transport
		..* TCPReceiverThread.java: Class responsible for receiving incoming connections.
		..* TCPServerThread.java: Class responsible for listening for incoming connections.
		..* TCPSender.java: Class responsible for sending messages.
	..* util
		..* OverlayCreator.java: Class responsible for creation of the node overlay and ensuring its validity.
		..* OverlayNode.java: Class responsible for storing info about nodes in overlay.
		..* OverlayEdge.java: Class responsible for storing info about edges in overlay.
		..* StatisticsCollectorAndDisplay: Class responsible for collecting statistics.
	..* wireformats
		..* Event.java: Interface containing info about events to be implemented by all messages/events in project.
		..* MessageNodeEvent.java: Class that handles all messaging nodes, message types, format ip,port,type
		..* Register.java: Class responsible for register message to registry.
		..* RegisterResponse.java: Class responsible for registry response to nodes on register message, success or fail.
		..* Deregister.java: Class responsible for deregister message to registry.
		..* TaskInitiate.java: Class responsible for initiating rounds from registry.
		..* TaskComplete.java: Class responsible for task complete message to registry.
		..* CreateLink.java: Class responsible for linking message between messaging nodes.
		..* Message.java: Class responsible for messages sent between messaging nodes during rounds.
		..* MessagingNodesList.java: Class responsible for registry sending of neighbors to each messaging node.
		..* PullTrafficSummary.java: Class responsible for registry requesting summary of traffic from all messaging nodes.
		..* TrafficSummary.java: Class responsible for messaging nodes sending traffic summaries to registry.
